This one was solved fairly fast. (15ish minutes, I will try to keep more accurate times moving forward)

Essentially for the solution with div it was just understanding how products worked, and using that
knowledge to understand that the easiest way would be to calculate the product and use that number
to then loop through and divide it. I could of imported math to calculate the product but I figured
I'd try to solve these problems without importing anything unless absolutely necessary.

The without Div solution was one of my first thoughts of solving the problem, but after reading the
problem I decided I should do it with divs first. I simply figured you should go through each element
of the list and remove that element, and then calculate the product. An issue I had realized was I
initially had each loop be:
for i in Original
like I did for the first solution, but when it came to i!=j an issue arrized where it would not
calculate the right number if there are a repeating numbers (like [10, 9, 11, 10, 9]) so I switched
it to keep track of the index instead. This problem does not arise for the first solution as it doesn't
matter if there is a repeating number, the division will work the same.
