I initially thought of doing it in a nested for loop like this:

for i in len(list)
	for j in range(i, len(list))
		if list[i]+list[j]==sum
			return true

Which would of been a quick and easy solution I got within a few minutes. 
However this would require more than one pass, so I spent a longer time 
thinking of a way to do it in one pass and remembered to store previous 
values in order to complete this problem in one pass.
