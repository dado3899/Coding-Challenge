After the nightmare that was the last problem this one was much easier (although it was labeled Hard by
the people at Daily Coding Problem, definitely need to refresh myself on classes). It took me around 5
minutes. I figured that if we know that the lowest possible starting (positive) int is 1 we can just
add one to that if we find that value in the list. The problem comes when the list is unsorted, so using
pythons handy sorted function we were able to easily solve that. This would of taken a bit more time if I
had to come up with a sorting function but luckily python had me covered.
